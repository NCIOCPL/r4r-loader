title: Detecting Mechanism of Action based Network Dysregulation (DeMAND)
description: >
  The DeMAND algorithm elucidates the mechanisms of action of cellular perturbations (for example, by small molecules or shRNA) using gene expression data generated from control and perturbed cells. The data are then used to identify network dysregulation to determine both the interactions and the genes that are involved in the mechanism of action.
