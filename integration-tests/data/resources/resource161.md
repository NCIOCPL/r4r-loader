Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in 3D Slicer open-source software. Load DICOM and nrrd/nhdr diffusion MRI medical image data. Perform tractography, compute scalar maps such as FA, and more. Load and save tractography in new DICOM format. Visualize, edit, and register multimodal data using 3D Slicer tools. Access all functionality through the graphical user interface. Perform command line batch processing.
