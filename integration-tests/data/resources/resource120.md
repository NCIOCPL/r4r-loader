MethylMix identifies differentially and transcriptionally predictive methylated genes within a disease. MethylMix identifies methylation states and compares them with the normal DNA methylation state. MethylMix also introduces a novel statistic, the Differential Methylation value or DM-value, to define methylation-driven subgroups
