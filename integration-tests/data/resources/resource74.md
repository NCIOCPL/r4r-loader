The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has developed a national repository of Patient-Derived Models (PDMs) comprised of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and in vitro patient-derived cell cultures (PDCs), including mixed cell populations, clonal cell lines and fibroblast cell lines to serve as a resource for public-private partnerships and for academic drug discovery efforts
