The OncoPPi Portal integrates genomic, pharmacological, clinical, and structural data from external resources with the network of cancer-associated protein-protein interactions (PPI) experimentally determined in cancer cells. This is an interactive web resource that allows users to access, explore, and prioritize cancer-relevant PPIs for target discovery.
