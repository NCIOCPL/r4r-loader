Bioconductor-based interface to Ivy-GAP (glioblastoma.alleninstitute.org) data resources. This app introduces users to quantitative elements of the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas project. This app allows interactive selection of (a) image features for scatterplotting, (b) image sets for stratified survival distribution estimation, and (c) gene sets for expression distribution comparison between strata.
