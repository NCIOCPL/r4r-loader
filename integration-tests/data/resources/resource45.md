title: S-PLUS Program for the Analysis of Accelerated Titration Design
description: >
    New "accelerated titration designs" for phase I clinical trials, along with a dose-toxicity model which can be used to evaluate the toxicity data. The dose-toxicity model can be used to assign the phase II starting dose, for the use of investigators conducting phase I studies.
