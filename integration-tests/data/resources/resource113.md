PhenStat is a freely available R package that provides a variety of statistical methods for the identification of phenotypic associations from model organisms developed for the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC at www.mousephenotype.org ). The methods have been developed for high throughput phenotyping pipelines implemented across various experimental designs with an emphasis on managing temporal variation and is being adapted for analysis with PDX mouse strains.
