description: >
  Users can mine data that are generated by measuring cellular responses to an 'Informer Set' of small-molecule probes and drugs for lineages or mutations enriched among cell lines sensitive to small molecules to identify new potential therapeutic vulnerabilities for different cancer types.

CTRP hosts data that are generated by measuring cellular responses to an 'Informer Set' of small-molecule probes and drugs. Users can mine for lineages or mutations enriched among cell lines sensitive to small molecules. By connecting cellular features to small molecule sensitivities, CTRP identifies new potential therapeutic vulnerabilities for different cancer types.
