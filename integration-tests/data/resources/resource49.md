Database of SOPs and peer-reviewed articles in the field of human Biospecimen Science. Each literature curation has been created by a Ph.D.-level scientist to capture the following: (1) relevant parameters that include the biospecimen investigated (type and location, patient diagnosis), preservation method, analyte(s) of interest and technology platform(s) used for analysis; (2) the pre-analytical factors investigated, including those relating to pre-acquisition, acquisition, preservation, processing, storage, and analysis; and (3) an original summary of relevant results. SOP documents are searchable by keyword, or by curated fields (source organization, tier, applicable biospecimens, and topic).
