A report of the most recent cancer incidence, mortality, survival, prevalence, and lifetime risk statistics. Published annually, the scope and purpose of this work are consistent with a report to the Senate Appropriations Committee (Breslow, 1988) which recommended that a broad profile of cancer be presented to the American public on a routine basis. This edition includes statistics from 1975 through 2014, the most recent year for which data are available.
