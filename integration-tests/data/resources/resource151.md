title: Virtual Inference of Protein-activity by Enriched Regulon analysis (VIPER)
description: >
  VIPER is the extension of Master Regulator Inference algorithm (MARINa) to single samples and to any protein having a regulatory role in the cell, including transcription factors (TFs) and signaling proteins.

VIPER is the extension of MARINa to single samples and to any protein having a regulatory role in the cell, including TFs and signaling proteins. It uses the transcripts most associated to each protein as an endogenous, multiplexed reported assay of its activity.
